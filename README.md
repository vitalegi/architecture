# README

Aim of the project is to build a tool that simplifies the generation/maintenance of [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) diagrams.

With this in mind, [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/)'s approach of diagrams and models as code is the best tool for the diagram generation.

What's found to be missing?

- Fast export of all diagrams
- Generation of additional documentation in a portable format (markdown, in our case)
- Auto-generation of containers/components

Repository structure:

- `structurizr-gen` contains the code/chart generator
